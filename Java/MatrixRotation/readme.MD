Write a function that takes an n x n matrix (a list of lists) and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise. The function should modify the matrix in place. 

Constraints:
The matrix is guaranteed to be square (i.e., the number of rows is equal to the number of columns).
You are not allowed to use any third-party libraries.

Example: Rotate to the right by 1

Input Matrix
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9

Output Matrix
7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3
